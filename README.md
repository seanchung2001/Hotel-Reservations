- Made-by: Sean Chung ([seanchung2001](http://www.github.com/seanchung2001))

## Minimum Requirements ##
- OS that allows compilation of C++ programs
- Compiler

## Tools ##
- GDB debugger
- Valgrind
- Gcc compiler
- Gedit

## Features ##
- Create a simulation of a hotel, and creating reservations for the hotel. The hotel stores Guests and Rooms which the Reservation manager uses to create necessary reservations for the hotel. The guests store loyalty points which are incremented by a certain amount after a reservation is made. This program can:
  - **(1) printReservations()**: Prints out all of the reservations that were made for with the given reservation manager in ascending order based on the arrival date of the                                    reservation.
  - **(2) printRooms()**: Print out all of the rooms in the hotel, formatted neatly (not in any given order).
  - **(3) printGuests()**: Print out all of the Guests registered for the hotel, formatted neatly (not in any given order). 
  - **(4) printRecords()**: Prints out all of the events, formatted neatly (not in any given order).

## Compiling Instructions ##
- **(1)**: Download all files included in this repository.
- **(2)**: Open the terminal and _cd_ into the proper directory.
- **(3)**: Type '_make_' into the terminal and wait for the compiler to compile.
- **(4)**:  Run the executable '_p2_' by doing '_./p2_' in the terminal. The menu should now appear.
